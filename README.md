The core classes, functions, and methods necessary for the snake game are:

1. `Game` class: This class will handle the game loop, user input, and game over conditions.
2. `Snake` class: This class will handle the snake's position, movement, and growth.
3. `Food` class: This class will handle the food's position and the action when the snake eats the food.
4. `draw_board` function: This function will draw the game board, the snake, and the food.

Now, let's write the code for each of these components.
